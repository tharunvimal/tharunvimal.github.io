  When I spent my grade 9 summer holidays in my hometown of Chennai, I heard about a volunteer group that was attempting to clean a beach called "Besant Nagar Beach." This iconic spot held a dear place in my heart as my family and I had made a lot of memories whilst spending our time at the beach. The quantity of trash along the shoreline was what first caught my attention. The sight of plastic waste endangering aquatic life appalled me. But I was adamant that I would change something. I joined forces with the group, and over the course of the following few days, we cleaned the shoreline of discards, planted new shrubs, and removed other such items that were being thrown into the ocean.

 Despite the work being extremely intensive, the pure joy we felt upon seeing the beach get restored to the beautiful location it was once renowned for The transformation of the beach from a littered shoreline to a clean and beautiful paradise was incredible to witness. This whole mission wasn't just about merely cleaning the beach; all of the people who had volunteered had learned valuable skills like teamwork and gained a deep understanding of the value that mother nature holds and the adverse effects of human actions on the ecosystem. I am grateful I got to participate in this mission.

          Before I started my journey with karate about eight years ago, I was a shy middle school student who wasn't very confident around other people. All this would change when I enrolled in a karate class near my residence. While I was a kid, I really enjoyed watching martial arts that would appear on TV and would spend hours watching boxing bouts or TV shows like the WWE, but it never occurred to me to try and learn a form of martial art myself.

Like a lot of people who start their journeys with martial arts, I was scared of all the intensive training and discipline the art demanded. Implementing these changes in my daily life was a challenge, but I felt myself fall in love with the sport. It taught me life lessons in areas such as discipline that I never thought I would learn.

  My journey with the sport has changed me as a person; I feel a lot more confident and don't find myself being shy in the presence of other people. I went on to rise through the levels of the sport and finally achieved a black belt, which signifies the highest level in the sport.

Ever since I stepped foot in that dojo eight years ago, I have changed as a person in a drastic way. I went from being an introverted and shy middle schooler to being a confident high schooler. The sport has taught me some of the greatest values in life.

    Basketball has always been a passion of mine since I was a kid. It was one of my favorite sports to play in my spare time, and I loved watching the game. However, I never considered applying to the basketball team at my school.

I gained a new appreciation for the sport as the tournament progressed. I was amazed by the cooperation and camaraderie that developed among my housemates while I was having fun playing with them. We were all working together to achieve a common objective, which was to win the house championship.

  I was determined to assist my house in winning. I worked on my shots and improved my game by practicing every day. I could feel my self-assurance increasing with each passing day. I no longer felt like an anxious and uneasy student. I was ready to take on the challenge now that I was a basketball player.

My nerves and excitement were pounding in my chest on the day of the final. I was completely focused and determined to give it my all when the game started. Both teams played their best, and the game was intense.

  I've always had a passion for reading, and as I read more,
  I found my spelling was improving. I then put myself to test by signing up for my school's spell bee competition.
   The rush of adrenaline I felt when my name was called and the excitement of realizing the spelling was perfect were both really gratifying experiences.
